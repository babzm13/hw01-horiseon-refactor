Refactoring of Horiseon code for bootcamp 1 homework

This homework was a refactoring of the Horiseon website. This was homework assignment 1. In this code, I refactored my code to be consistent with accessibility norms by exchanging divs for things like header, footer, section, and aside. Some divs were left behind as they were structural to the CSS looking right, not logical groupings in the page.

The CSS was refactored to remove redundant code, shift the code around to make it follow readability and findability norms, and commented in places that were tricky.

The website can be seen in its deployed form here: https://babzm13.github.io/hw01-horiseon-refactor/

A screenshot of the completed website can be seen here:
